My research objective is to develop a fundamental understanding of nanostructure-property-performance relationships of advanced energy materials using multiscale simulation methods (e.g., density functional theory calculations, atomistic/coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, continuum modeling, and machine learning) and to build the link between molecular insights and macroscopic properties (e.g., transport, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, etc.). The molecular understanding of the correlation between physicochemical properties of energy materials can be extended to other functional materials including membranes, colloids, porous materials, biological materials, etc.

Below, I outline some of the projects.

1. _**Structure-property-performace**_ relationships in novel battery electrolytes including _**liquid electrolytes**_ and _**polymer electrolytes**_

Nanostructure of battery electrolytes, especially the solvation environment of cation, is critical to affecting the property of battery electrolytes and further affecting the performance of related energy storage and conversion devices. For example, the ion pair condition can impact the ionic conductivity and the solvation structure corresponds to the electrochemical stability. High ionic conductivity is needed for supporting the high current density required for fast charging and discharging rates of energy storage devices, and wide electrochemical window will contribute to high energy density of energy storage devices. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of structure-property-performance relationship in many novel electrolytes (e.g., super-concentrated, redox-flow, multivalent, polymer, and ionic liquid-based electrolytes) is highly desired.

2. _**Interfacial and transport phenomena**_ involved in energy storage and conversion process

Interfacial properties play an important role in the performance of the energy storage and conversion facilities including batteries and supercapacitors. The study of the interface between electrolyte and electrode can be divided into two aspects. Physically, the classical theories for electric double layers (EDLs) in dilute electrolytes and high-temperature molten salts might not accurately describe EDLs at the interface between electrolytes with nanometric ionic aggregates and strongly electriofied surfaces due to the ionic volume exclusion. Chemically, the interface between the electrolyte and electrode is where the actual electrochemical reaction occur. The solid electrolyte interphases formed at the interface have been considered as an indispensable component to stabilize battery cycling. Nevertheless, the composition, structure, and formation mechansim of the resultant SEI haven't been understood completely.
