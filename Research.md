My research objective is to develop a fundamental understanding of nanostructure-property-performance relationships of advanced energy materials using multiscale simulation methods (e.g., density functional theory calculations, atomistic/coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, continuum modeling, and machine learning) and to build the link between molecular insights and macroscopic properties (e.g., transport, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, etc.). The molecular understanding of the correlation between physicochemical properties of energy materials can be extended to other functional materials including membranes, colloids, porous materials, biological materials, etc.

Below, I outline some of the projects.

1. _**Structure-property-performace**_ relationships in novel battery electrolytes including _**liquid electrolytes**_ and _**polymer electrolytes**_
  
  1.1 Liquid electrolytes
  
  
  1.2 Polymer electrolytes
  
  

2. _**Interfacial and transport phenomena**_ involved in energy storage and conversion process






3. Separation

  3.1 Gas-Solid separation
  
  3.2 Desalination through GO membranes
  
  3.3 Separation of rare earth element using ionic liquids
