I am Zhou (Joe) Yu, a postdoc research associate in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory since November 2021. I have received my first postdoc training in the Materials Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory from February 2019 to November 2021. I earned my Ph.D. in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech in December 2018.



toral researcher in Argonne National Laboratory. My current work focuses on the atomistic modeling of liquid electrolytes.

My doctoral research explored the interfacial phenomena (e.g. electrical double layer, interfacial fluids, self-assembly etc.) in some advanced materials (e.g., room-temperature ionic liquid, polymeric ion gel, nanoscale ionic materials, polymerized ionic liquids etc.) using multiscale simulation methods including molecular dynamics and CFD.
