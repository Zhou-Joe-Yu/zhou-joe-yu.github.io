I am Zhou (Joe) Yu, a postdoctoral researcher in Argonne National Laboratory. My current work focuses on the atomistic modeling of liquid electrolytes.

My doctoral research explored the interfacial phenomena (e.g. electrical double layer, interfacial fluids, self-assembly etc.) in some advanced materials (e.g., room-temperature ionic liquid, polymeric ion gel, nanoscale ionic materials, polymerized ionic liquids etc.) using multiscale simulation methods including molecular dynamics and CFD.
